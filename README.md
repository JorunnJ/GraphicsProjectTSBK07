# Description
This is a project in graphics for the course TSBK03 created by by my friends and me. Our goal was to experiment with varying graphics techniques, and therefore created this project which we called "Cozy Cabin". 

Some of the techniques we used include shadow mapping, billboards, custom objects and textures created in Blender, and skyboxes.

# Runing the project
The project uses files created for our course TSBK07, which are necessary to run this project. These files can be found at https://computer-graphics.se/TSBK07/laboration-1-2.html, "common.zip".
